# Rock, Paper, Scissors
## A practice project for the Odin Project

---

A simple game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors". The user can play using the mouse or keyboard. Pressing "b" allows the user to cheat and assumes the user's name is "Warzel".


### Things that need to be improved:

* Clean up code and get rid of old variables that are no longer in use!
* Possibly change the way images are alternated in the overlay
* Improve transition effect in the Cheat-Overlay
